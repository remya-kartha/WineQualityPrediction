# WineQualityPrediction
This is a machine learning project which compares different classification algorithms to predict the quality of wine

The objective of this project is to predict the quality of wine as bad-good (scale 1-10) using machinelearning algorithms in Python. 
The dataset is used to create models to predict the quality of wine through different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity etc.
Multiple Classification models are applied and the accuracy score for the different models are compared.
The model with best accuracy score will be used to help predict the quality of the wine as Good or Bad
